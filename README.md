## About This Project

This portfolio marks my initial step into the world of web development. It was **intentionally designed as an HTML- and CSS-only project** to solidify foundational frontend skills and document my learning progress. While it doesn't yet contain complex content, it reflects my commitment to writing clean and responsive code.

Beyond the technical aspects, this site also offers a personal glimpse into my interests, including my fitness goals and my Serbian Orthodox Christian faith, which are important pillars in my life and influence my disciplined approach to projects.

## Technologies

This project is built with a focus on a solid foundation:

* **HTML5:** For structuring and semantically marking up the content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsive adaptations. Particular emphasis was placed on using CSS variables for easy theme management, as well as Flexbox and Grid for efficient layouts.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **"Frosted Glass" Navigation:** A modern design element that adds depth and elegance.
* **Interactive Contact Form:** A straightforward way to get in touch with me.
* **Placeholder Projects Section:** A dedicated area for showcasing future works.
* **Personal "About Me" Section:** A brief introduction to myself and my interests.
